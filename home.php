                <p class="long-copy">PepEngine is a non-proteogenic amino-acid specific database of bioactive peptides containing Dehydro-Phenyl-Alanine and Amino-Iso-Butyric Acid. PepEngine holds *** peptides having either of the non-proteogenic amino-acids that are relevant in peptide engineering for antibiotics and peptide-based drugs. Every existent in PepEngine provides a synoptic of peptide's Sequence, Structure, Dihedral Angles, Torsion Angles, and Biological Activity that are grouped under the umbrella of *** Dehydro-Phenyl-Alanine containing peptides and *** Amino-Iso-Butyric Acid containing peptides respectively. It is designed through an extensive manual curation of relevant scientific literature along with text mining.
